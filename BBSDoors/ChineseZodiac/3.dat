`07The Cock is a hard worker, shrewd and definite in decision making,
often speaking his mind.  Because of this, you tend to seem boastful
to others.  You are a dreamer, flashy dresser and extravagant to an
extreme.

`0CYou should be happy as a restaurant owner, publicist, soldier or
a world traveler.

`0DSome of your fellow famous Cocks:
Rudyard Kipling, Caruso, Groucho Marx and Peter Ustinov.
