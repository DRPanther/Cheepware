# Cheepware BBS Doors

These are my DOS-based BBS doors.  

If you want to download the official release archives, look in the 
[Releases](https://github.com/digimaus/Cheepware/tree/master/BBSDoors/Releases) 
folder.

## Compiling the doors
You will need to use either Turbo Pascal or Borland Pascal 7 to compile 
the doors.

If you want to compile these "as-is":

1. Download the FKFOSSIL archive and put the correct TPU into your /tp or
bp/bin directory.
2. Download all of the files in the Common directory and put them into your
/tp or bp/bin directory.
3. All of the doors should compile on the first try if you have your
compiler set up correctly.

Please remember that I am not obligated to offer support for this software
and support may end at any time with or without notice or reason.
