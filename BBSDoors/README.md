# Cheepware BBS Doors

These are my DOS-based BBS doors.  You will need to use either Turbo Pascal
or Borland Pascal 7 to compile them.

If you want to compile these "as-is":

1. Download the FKFOSSIL archive and put the correct TPU into your /tp or
bp/bin directory.
2. Download all of the files in the Common directory and put them into your
/tp or bp/bin directory.
3. All of the doors should compile on the first try if you have your
compiler set up correctly.

Please remember that I am not obligated to offer support for this software
and support may end at any time with or without notice or reason.
