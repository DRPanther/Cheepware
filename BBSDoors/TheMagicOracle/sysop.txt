This program is a BBS door.  If you do not know what that is, you really
shouldn't try to use this program.  This door is for entertainment purposes
only, of course.

This door is freeware.  If you have been charged for its use, both you and I
have been ripped off!

II. WHAT IS THE MAGIC ORACLE?

  The Magic Oracle (TMO) is a BBS door that can be run locally or through a
  BBS that is capable of running 16-bit DOS doors.  This door is a knockoff
  of a very sarcastic Magic 8 Ball(R).  Features of this door:

    - Supports DOOR.SYS and DORINFO1.DEF drop files.
    - DOS, DesqView, Windows, and OS/2 timeslicer friendly.
    - ANSI.SYS not needed as the door has its own ANSI driver.
    - Uses Telegard-style color codes for customization.

  This door runs under DOS, 32-bit Windows, OS/2 (including eComStation and
  ArcaOS), and Linux using DOSemu.

  Requirements to run TMO:

    - A BBS that is capable of running 16-bit DOS doors and can produce
      either DOOR.SYS or DORINFO1.DEF dropfiles.
    - A FOSSIL driver.
    - ANSI.SYS is NOT required as the door has its own ANSI driver.
    - The user must have ANSI emulation enabled.

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

III. UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF TMO

  If you're upgrading from a previous version, here's some important things
  you need to know:

    - Before you install this, back up your ANSWER.DAT file.
    - This version of TMO does not require any .CFG or .CTL file as it reads
      all its needed information from the dropfile.  You may safely delete all
      *.CFG and *.CTL files as well as MAKECTL.EXE.
    - This version uses Telegard-style color codes.  If your version uses any
      other color codes in the *.DAT files (such as TDK or pipe), you will need
      to convert the color codes to Telegard-style color codes.
    - This version has multinode support in it.  Yep.  Only took me two
      decades to figure it out ...
    - This upgrade is highly recommended since I do not support ANY of the
      previous versions of The Magic Oracle.

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

IV. SETTING UP TMO

  Thankfully, TMO is very easy to setup.  Here's the steps to set up a new
  installation:

    - Create a directory for the door and extract the archive in it.  If
      you have customized ANSWER.DAT and/or LANGUAGE.DAT files, you
      can copy them over the stock DAT files (make sure you change the
      color codes as mentioned in "Customizing TMO").
    - Run ORACLE /L to create INDEX.DAT (a small file that tells TMO
      how many "answers" are in ANSWERS.DAT; makes it faster for your
      users).
    - Create a batch file to run the door from your BBS (or if you run
      Synchronet, you can run it directly from the door menu).
    - Add TMO into your BBS's door menu and you're set.

  Command line parameters you can use:

    /N<node> - Specifies what node number to use.  Single-line BBSes
               don't need to use this parameter. (DORINFO1.DEF)
    /D<path> - Specifies the full path and filename of what dropfile to
               use (DOOR.SYS or DORINFO1.DEF).
    /F       - Force ANSI emulation on (doesn't always work!).
    /L       - Run the door in local mode.
    /?       - View the door's help screen (or ORACLE on the command line).

  You must specify the path to the dropfile, and if you are using 
  DORINFO1.DEF, the node number in the calling command line.  If your BBS 
  requires a batch file to run a door like mine does, here's how to do 
  it.  I run a multinode Maximus/2 BBS and this is my setup to run 
  TMO.  I created a batch file called RUNTMO.BAT:

    @echo off
    d:
    cd\doors\oracle
    oracle /n%1 /dd:\max\node%1\dorinfo1.def
    cd\max\node%1

  If you're going to use DOOR.SYS, you can use this batch file:

    @echo off
    d:
    cd\doors\oracle
    oracle /dd:\max\node%1\door.sys
    cd\max\node%1

  TIP: If you have set up one of my doors already and have created this
       batch file, just copy that and substitute the name of this door
       in that file.  It'll save you some time!

  How I set up TMO in Maximus's MENUS.CTL:

  NoDsp Display_File    Misc\dorinfo    Unverified "T"
           Xtern_DOS    runtmo.bat_%k   Unverified "The Magic Oracle"

  DORINFO is my MECCA file to create the DORINFO1.DEF dropfile.
  RUNTMO.BAT is located in \MAX.

  You can pass the node number to the batch file from your BBS (please
  check your BBS documentation on how to do this).  If you're running
  a single-line BBS, you can omit the /N parameter and the door will
  assume that you are running a single-line BBS.  You must still make
  sure that the correct fully qualified path to your dropfile is used.

  If you need an example on how to use the door, just type ORACLE at
  the command prompt and a small help screen will appear.

  A quick note about the status bar you see when the door is running on
  your BBS with a remote caller...the status bar looks like this:

    <door name and author information>
    <caller name>     <node #> <OS> <COM port> <emulation> <KP> <TL>

  It's easy to understand, but there's a few things you should know:

    - <OS> will always show as "DOS" under Windows.  If you're running
      the door under OS/2, eComStation, or ArcaOS, it will say "OS/2".
    - <KP> is the number of seconds since the last keypress.  Due to the
      way multitasking OSes work, this may not be updated every second,
      but it is accurate.
    - <TL> is the time left before the door kicks the user off.

  Some miscellaneous notes about the door from user reports:

    - Some sysops are having problems using DOOR.SYS.  Since there's so many
      variations on how DOOR.SYS is used, I recommend using DORINFO1.DEF as
      that is more standardized.  If you do use DOOR.SYS, you need to use the
      full 52-line version as produced by GAP BBS software (whose authors 
      developed the original DOOR.SYS dropfile).  Any other version of
      DOOR.SYS, such as the "short" version Doorway uses, will not work.
    - My doors running under Windows XP are occasionally having a hard
      time figuring out whether they are using ANSI or not; you may need to
      force ANSI manually to the door (changing the dropfile if possible) if
      you have problems with this.  You can also use the /F parameter to force
      ANSI emulation on but this does not always work.
    - Doors running under DOSemu in Linux may have issues with not running due
      to the executable being compressed.  This is a rather uncommon issue but
      if you are having problems, please contact me directly and I can produce
      an uncompressed executable for you.

V. CUSTOMIZING TMO

  ANSWERS.DAT is a standard text file.  You can have up to 32,767
  multiple-line "answers" in the file.  Each full answer is separated
  by a percent sign (%) at the top and bottom of the answer but every
  line in each individual answer must be shorter than 79 characters or
  else unpredictable results will occur.  The line length does NOT
  include the length of the color codes as they are stripped out of the
  string as it's displayed.  After you modify ANSWERS.DAT, delete INDEX.DAT
  and run TMO locally to rebuild the index file.

  TMO supports Telegard-style color codes in ANSWERS.DAT. The advantage to
  these codes is that you can change the foreground and background colors 
  at the same time.  Each color code start with the color sequence indicator
  (`), followed by two characters from 0 to 9, A to F, form the color code.

  The color codes are listed below (low and high intensity side by side).
