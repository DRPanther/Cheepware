# Official Cheepware Releases

These archives are official Cheepware releases by me, Sean Dennis, and 
are officially supported.  These are the doors that I continue to 
develop and support.

To run these doors, you will need a BBS that supports 16-bit DOS 
programs, a FOSSIL driver, and either the full 52-line DOOR.SYS or 
DORINFO1.DEF dropfiles.  The user will need a terminal client that 
supports ANSI graphics.

Here's a description of each door from its FILE_ID.DIZ:
