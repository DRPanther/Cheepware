This program is a BBS door.  If you do not know what that is, you really
shouldn't try to use this program.  This door is for entertainment purposes
only, of course.

II. WHAT IS ATTITUDE ASSESSMENT?

  Attitude Assessment (AA) is a BBS door that can be run locally or through
  a BBS that is capable of running 16-bit DOS doors.  This door is a
  fun, non-scientific "attitude assessment".  Features of this door:

    - Supports DOOR.SYS and DORINFO1.DEF drop files.
    - DOS, DesqView, Windows, and OS/2 timeslicer friendly.
    - ANSI.SYS not needed as the door has its own ANSI driver.

  This door runs under DOS, 32-bit Windows, OS/2 (including eComStation and
  ArcaOS), and Linux using DOSemu.


  Requirements to run AA:

    - A BBS that is capable of running 16-bit DOS doors and can produce
      either DOOR.SYS or DORINFO1.DEF dropfiles.
    - A FOSSIL driver.
    - ANSI.SYS is NOT required as the door has its own ANSI driver.
    - The user must have ANSI emulation enabled.

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

III. UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF AA

  If you're upgrading from a previous version, here's some important things
  you need to know:

    - Copy the new executable over the old one.  That's it!
    - This version has multinode support in it.  Yep.  Only took me two
      decades to figure it out ...
    - This upgrade is highly recommended since I do not support ANY of the
      previous versions of Attitude Assessment.

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

IV. SETTING UP AA

  Thankfully, AA is very easy to setup.  Here's the steps to set up a new
  installation:

    - Create a directory for the door and extract the archive in it.
    - Create a batch file to run the door from your BBS (or if you run
      Synchronet, you can run it directly from the door menu).
    - Add AA into your BBS's door menu and you're set.

  Command line parameters you can use:

    /N<node> - Specifies what node number to use.  Single-line BBSes
               don't need to use this parameter.  If your system uses
               DOOR.SYS, you can skip this as the node number in use
               is provided by DOOR.SYS.
    /D<path> - Specifies the full path and filename of what dropfile to
               use (DOOR.SYS or DORINFO1.DEF).
    /F       - Force ANSI emulation on (doesn't always work!).
    /L       - Run the door in local mode.
    /?       - View the door's help screen (or ATTITUDE on the command line).

  You must specify the path to the dropfile, and if you are using 
  DORINFO1.DEF, the node number in the calling command line.  If your BBS 
  requires a batch file to run a door like mine does, here's how to do 
  it.  I run a multinode Maximus/2 BBS and this is my setup to run 
  AA.  I created a batch file called RUNAA.BAT:

    @echo off
    d:
    cd\doors\attitude
    attitude /n%1 /dd:\max\node%1\dorinfo1.def
    cd\max\node%1

  If you're going to use DOOR.SYS, you can use this batch file:

    @echo off
    d:
    cd\doors\attitude
    attitude /dd:\max\node%1\door.sys
    cd\max\node%1

  TIP: If you have set up one of my doors already and have created this
       batch file, just copy that and substitute the name of this door
       in that file.  It'll save you some time!

  How I set up AA in Maximus's MENUS.CTL:

  NoDsp Display_File    Misc\dorinfo    Unverified "A"
           Xtern_DOS    runaa.bat_%k    Unverified "Attitude Assessment"

  DORINFO is my MECCA file to create the DORINFO1.DEF dropfile.
  RUNAA.BAT is located in \MAX.

  You can pass the node number to the batch file from your BBS (please
  check your BBS documentation on how to do this).  If you're running
  a single-line BBS, you can omit the /N parameter and the door will
  assume that you are running a single-line BBS.  You must still make
  sure that the correct fully qualified path to your dropfile is used.

  If you need an example on how to use the door, just type ORACLE at
  the command prompt and a small help screen will appear.

  A quick note about the status bar you see when the door is running on
  your BBS with a remote caller...the status bar looks like this:

    <door name and author information>
    <caller name>     <node #> <OS> <COM port> <emulation> <KP> <TL>

  It's easy to understand, but there's a few things you should know:

    - <OS> will always show as "DOS" under Windows.  If you're running
      the door under OS/2, eComStation, or ArcaOS, it will say "OS/2".
    - <KP> is the number of seconds since the last keypress.  Due to the
      way multitasking OSes work, this may not be updated every second,
      but it is accurate.
    - <TL> is the time left before the door kicks the user off.

  Some miscellaneous notes about the door from user reports:

    - Some sysops are having problems using DOOR.SYS.  Since there's so many
      variations on how DOOR.SYS is used, I recommend using DORINFO1.DEF as
      that is more standardized.  If you do use DOOR.SYS, you need to use the
      full 52-line version as produced by GAP BBS software (whose authors 
      developed the original DOOR.SYS dropfile).  Any other version of
      DOOR.SYS, such as the "short" version Doorway uses, will not work.
    - My doors running under Windows XP are occasionally having a hard
      time figuring out whether they are using ANSI or not; you may need to
      force ANSI manually to the door (changing the dropfile if possible) if
      you have problems with this.  You can also use the /F parameter to force
      ANSI emulation on but this does not always work.
    - Doors running under DOSemu in Linux may have issues with not running due
      to the executable being compressed.  This is a rather uncommon issue but
      if you are having problems, please contact me directly and I can produce
      an uncompressed executable for you.

VII. CREDITS AND THANKS

  Attitude Assessment was developed using Turbo Pascal 7 (RTE200 patched) and
  FKFOSSIL v1.02 under ArcaOS 5.0.3 and DOSemu under Devuan Linux.

  The main executable was packed using aPACK.

  The door was initially tested on my own BBS using Maximus/2 v3.01 under
  ArcaOS 5.0.3.
