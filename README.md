# Cheepware

This is the official repository for the Cheepware line of BBS doors and
sysop utilities developed by Sean Dennis.

All of the software in this repository is released under my Cheepware 
License (a modified 4-clause BSD license) in hopes that this software 
will be found useful.

The official Cheepware website is at:
https://outpostbbs.net/cheepware.html

Support for this software may stop at any time with or without notice or 
reason.  I will try to give support as much as possible but be aware 
that it works here and it may not work there ...
