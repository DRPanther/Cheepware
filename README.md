# Cheepware

This is the official repository for the Cheepware line of BBS doors and 
sysop utilities developed by Sean Dennis.

If you are looking for the officially released BBS door archives, look 
under the [Cheepware/BBSDoors/Releases](https://github.com/digimaus/Cheepware/tree/master/BBSDoors/Releases) 
directory.

All of the source code and its accompanying documentation in this 
repository is released under my Cheepware License (a modified 4-clause 
BSD license) in hopes that this software will be found useful.

The official Cheepware website is at: 
https://outpostbbs.net/cheepware.html

Support for this software may stop at any time with or without notice or 
reason.  I will try to give support as much as possible but be aware 
that it works here and it may not work there ...
